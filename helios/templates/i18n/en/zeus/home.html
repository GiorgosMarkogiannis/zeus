    <h3>Zeus Elections</h3>
    <p>Hold verifiable elections with one or more polls.
       Several different ballot types and election systems are supported,
       such as simple questions with predefined answers,
       party lists, score voting, or single transferable vote (STV).
       Zeus was initially forked from <a href="http://heliosvoting.org">Helios</a>
       and maintains the general workflow but has since significantly diverged.</p>
       Zeus has served more than <b>830</b> electronic ballots and
       <b>230,000</b> voters for Greek Universities and other bodies in
       Greece and abroad (Scientific Associations, Unions, etc.).
